ATTACK CTI Overview
===================

The ATTACK-Python-Client project provides a python library named ``attackcti`` which wraps the functionality of `cti-python-stix2 <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-python-stix2>`_ and `cti-taxii-client <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-taxii-client>`_ libraries developed by MITRE.
This python wrapper allows ATT&CK users to query STIX content from the ATT&CK public TAXII server via pre-defined functions with a few lines of code.

Requirements
############

* Python3

Installation
############

The ``attackcti`` library can be installed via PIP:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install attackcti

Or you can install it from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/OTRF/ATTACK-Python-Client
    $ cd ATTACK-Python-Client
    $ pip install .

Quick Start
###########

You can simply import the ``attackcti`` library and start retrieving ATT&CK content in STIX from its public TAXII server:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from attackcti import attack_client
    >>> lift = attack_client()
    >>> all_enterprise = lift.get_enterprise()

    >>> len(all_enterprise)
    10

    >>> all_enterprise.keys()
    dict_keys(['techniques', 'mitigations', 'groups', 'malware', 'tools', 'relationships', 'tactics', 'matrix', 'identity', 'marking-definition'])

    >>> len(all_enterprise['techniques'])
    244

    >>> all_enterprise["techniques"][0]

By default, the data returned by the available functions in the attackcti library is of type ``stix2``:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> type(all_enterprise['techniques'][0])
    <class 'stix2.v20.sdo.AttackPattern'>

However, you can use the available ``stix_format`` parameter and set it to ``False``  to return a dictionary and with a more friendly field name schema as shown below:

.. code-block:: python

    >>> all_enterprise_friendly = lift.get_enterprise(stix_format=False)
    >>> type(all_enterprise_friendly['techniques'][0])
    <class 'dict'>
 
    >>> len(all_enterprise_friendly['techniques'])
    244

    >>> all_enterprise_friendly['techniques'][0]
